<h2>Lets now hop onto making some chai for a break </h2>
<p>Chai, also known as Indian tea, is more than just a beverage; it's a comforting ritual cherished across India and around the world. Made by brewing tea leaves with milk, water, sugar, and aromatic spices like ginger, cardamom, and cloves, chai is a flavorful and invigorating drink that brings warmth to your soul.

    Every household has its unique way of making chai, with variations ranging from strong and bold to light and creamy. Whether it's enjoyed as a morning pick-me-up, an afternoon companion, or during heartfelt conversations with friends and family, chai holds a special place in Indian culture.
    
    Its rich aroma and soothing taste make chai the perfect drink for any occasion. Paired with snacks like biscuits, pakoras, or samosas, it creates an unforgettable experience that unites people with its simplicity and charm.</p>
